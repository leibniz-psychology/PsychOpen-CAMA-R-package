(2) Study had to contain at least one sample in which infants responded to a mathematically incorrect and correct number of items, (3) Study had to compare infants’ lookingtimes at these items.Exclusion: (1) Insufficient information was reported to compute the effect size, (2) the researcher did not provide required statistics when contacted",
