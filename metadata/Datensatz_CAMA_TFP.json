    "literatureSelection": "Inclusion: Quantitative studies on the trauma film paradigm from the first development of the paradigm in 1960 in which a trauma paradigm is used; intrusive memories are measured and a group comparison was made for intrusion reduction; At least two groups of adult and healthy participants; The comparator is a control condition relative to the intervention or manipulation; At least one between-group comparison; At least one measure for intrusion frequency",

    "hierarchicalStructure": "Some samples consisted of multiple interventions and control groups. An effect size was calculated for each active intervention vs. passive control group."
